# Hobot
This is my project, more like a code along with TheCherno's game engine series, in which I'm trying to implement a game engine.  
This repository isn't open for pull requests yet.  
Also it will not have releases yet.

# Vendors/Dependencies
I used:
* premake, its license can be found in vendor/premake.
* glfw3-4, its license can be found in Hobot/vendor/glfw-3.4.
